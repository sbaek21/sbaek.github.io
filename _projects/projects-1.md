# locationlocationlocation

A project for CodeADA 2022, a two day hackathon held by WCS.

Participants choice winner!

## Description
Some energy sources are better than others for certain amount of land. Different contexts of locations make a rapid 
clean energy transition more complicated.

`locationlocationlocation` is a data-driven solution that allows energy providers and community members to determine 
the best energy source for their area, with a simple and intuitive interface.

- Designed and implemented user interfaces and location-based input features using React and Google Maps API to enhance usability.
- Streamlined backend-frontend interactions, ensuring efficient data flow and system reliability for renewable energy predictions.
- Developed a Flask-based backend to integrate Python predictive models with a React frontend, enabling seamless energy source analysis.
