## Description
Recipe Builder is a web application designed to help users find recipes based on ingredients they already have at home. The app recommends recipes from a database of over 2 million options and incorporates features like filtering, sorting, and nutritional insights to enhance user experience. By using the app, users can reduce food waste, save time, and make healthier eating choices.

Key features include:
- **Ingredient-Based Search**: Enter ingredients to get recipe recommendations tailored to available items.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Filter recipes by dish type or number of ingredients, and sort results by difficulty, relevance, or simplicity.
- **Nutritional Insights**: Integrated nutrition facts for recipes, showing details like fat, carbs, and protein.
- **Personal Journaling**: Users can log their cooking experiences and save favorite recipes for future reference.
- **Dynamic Modal View**: A pop-up displays detailed recipe instructions and nutritional information for easy navigation.

This project leverages a combination of large recipe and nutrition datasets to provide a unique and convenient solution for home cooks.
