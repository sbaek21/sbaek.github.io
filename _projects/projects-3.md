## Description

"Escape the Grainger" is a third-person, side-scrolling platformer game that challenges players to navigate increasingly difficult levels while overcoming a variety of obstacles. Players must dodge spikes, avoid fire pits, collect coins, and manage health to successfully escape.

The game features:
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Players face obstacles like spikes and fire pits while collecting health packs and coins.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Levels become more complex as players progress, requiring strategic thinking and quick reflexes.
- **Checkpoint System**: Saves player progress, allowing them to restart from the last checkpoint after losing health.
