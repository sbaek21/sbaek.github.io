I am a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/). My academic and professional work focuses on human-computer interaction, data systems, and accessibility technologies. I have developed user-centric applications, built AI-driven solutions, and explored innovative approaches to making technology more inclusive and impactful.

My experience includes projects in accessibility research, energy modeling, and game development, where I applied advanced problem-solving and programming skills to deliver scalable and efficient solutions. I am passionate about leveraging computer science to address real-world challenges and create meaningful, user-friendly technologies.
